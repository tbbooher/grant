%h2 Grant the Great

%p
  We've always had lots of nicknames for our kids. Grant was no different. Dinkster, Dink-a-boo,
  Dink-a-saurus Rex, and Grant the Great. Grant's light in our lives began as a wonderful gift
  on Christmas Day, 2005 when we discovered that God had entrusted us with another soul to raise
  for Him. Our baby boy was born in Las Vegas, Nevada on August 23r, 2006 and was baptized in Christ
  on September 30', 2006 with his godparents Uncle Chris and Aunt Mary by his side.
  His sisters delighted in a new baby brother and from the earliest years, he and his big brother
  Ryan were constant companions, with little brother Troy joining later as another best friend.
%h2 Who was Grant?

  He was a sweet, sensitive little boy with a heart for serving and sharing. It gave him great
  joy to divide his candy equally among eager siblings, to offer dessert to a sibling who had lost his, to give money to the poor, to give away a prized possession, saying "I want you to have
  this." He was given a gift for compassion and would advocate for amnesty even for a sibling who had wronged him. He loved being from a big family. His grandparents, great grandparents,
  uncles, aunts, and dozens of cousins were a source of unspeakable happiness for him. He loved being surrounded with the love of family. He wanted to be home and home was wherever the
  family was. He loved cuddling on the couch with warm, fuzzy blankets, asking for "just one more" chapter of a book to be read. He loved surprising us with acts of service. It was usual to
  have him say, "Mom, look, I cleaned the living room. I vacuumed the side patio. I made all the beds." He loved to minister to others. He would lead a tired parent by the hand to a recliner and
  say, "You have been working so hard, come sit." He would bring water, slippers, and piano music. It gave him great joy.

  He would rush to carry in twice as many grocery bags as his siblings and struggle to carry three gallons of milk at the same time. He'd say, "Mom, don't worry, I'll get that" when
  something needed to get done. He was the first to say "Thank you for this great meal," "Thank you for taking us here," "Thank you for the work you do, Dad." He loved playing sports with his
  brothers, wrestling, playing board games, collecting bugs, and jumping from the stairs into his Dad's arms. He loved little children. He had a special place in his heart for his baby brother,
  Luke and was always delighted to hold him. He had a special love for animals, nestling the dogs in his own blankets to make beds for them, trying to hatch a robin's egg so he could have a pet,
  feeling deep concern for the "poor" pony that was effortlessly pulling a small cart behind it. His heartfelt, introspective prayers showed a deep well of love and concern for others. He was so
  sad to see others suffer. He accepted apologies quickly, responding with forgiveness, a hug, and an eagerness to get back to playing together.

  Looking back, in many ways, the Holy Spirit was preparing us that the soul entrusted to us 6 and one-half years ago would be renaming
  home to his Creator. In the past three months, we were blessed with
  more carefree timelessness as a family than we have had in years. We read Little Pilgrim's
  Progress together this past month, a story about children on their journey to heaven. Grant couldn't wait and read the whole book himself. He was so excited to read the final chapters this
  past week, with the children arriving in the Celestial City. Grant said that this life was just "God's hotel," a stopping place on our way Home. When his sister asked him this past week
  where he would go if he could go anywhere, he enthusiastically said, "Heaven." When Holly asked again where he would go on this earth, he persisted in his same response, "Heaven." We were
  blessed to go to Mass three times in the five days before Grant died, with the priest urging us to add "but Thy Will be done" to the end of each one of our prayers. We were all able to hug
  and kiss Grant and tell him we loved him during the Sign of Peace at Mass two hours before his accident.

%p
  His little tea light on earth touched many. In his dying and death, He brought us all to our knees because it was the only place to go. he was surrounded with thousands of prayers from family,
  friends, and strangers that transformed his little tea light on earth into a chandelier in heaven that is touching so many more. He would have been so grateful to the scores of medical personnel who gave all they had trying to save him, to those who let his mother fly on the helicopter with her dying son, for the priest who was there in minutes to administer Last Rites, to Fr Rathan, who spent hours with our family during the longest 36 hours of our lives, saying Mass at Grant's bedside twice, administering his 1st Holy Communion and Confirmation, taking the name of his favorite saint, Padre Pio. He would have been grateful to each one of you, for the support, love,
  faith, and hope you surround us with and the mercies that are new each morning that remind us of God's love and presence.

  Sleep well, our sweet prince, you are home at last. We love you so much!!!
